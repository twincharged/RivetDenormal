To use this repo: clone, start up Redis and Postgres, run migrations. Make sure Postgres is version 9.3, the latest. If you're going to use Rails' development environment, replace the fake S3 access and secret access keys with real ones in carrierwave_init.rb. Otherwise, it will work straight out of the box for Rails' test environment. Read the Readme.rdoc raw for more details.

Angular is annoying right now.
