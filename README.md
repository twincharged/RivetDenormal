To use this repo: clone, start up Redis and Postgres, run migrations. Make sure Postgres is version 9.3, the latest. If you're going to use Rails' development environment, replace the fake S3 access and secret access keys with real ones in carrierwave_init.rb. Otherwise, it will work straight out of the box for Rails' test environment. Read the Readme.rdoc raw for more details.

The server is now running solely on the sub-frameworks ActiveRecord and ActionController with the intention of bringing ActionMailer on board at a later date. This is because the server is agnostic towards clients, only spitting out a JSON API.

Was almost successful at implementing Faye in Rails and Angular. Everything was working nicely, then I did something that started throwing some weird JS errors involving null databinding and insertBefore functions. I belive the problem started happening when I switched from WEBbrick to Thin. Sigh... unfortunately I will pull from my last push and wipe the errors along with the Faye progress.
